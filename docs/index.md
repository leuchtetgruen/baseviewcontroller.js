BaseViewController documentation index
======================================

BaseViewController is a javascript framework based on [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) and [ jQuery ](http://jquery.com/).
It aims to provide a full comfortable model-view-controller architecture for developing front side webapplications.

It provides view encapsulation using the [BaseView](baseview.md) mechanism. Those views can be automatically injected into
view controllers that use the [BaseViewController](baseviewcontroller.md) extension to Backbones View class. And they can also be bound to attributes of models via the [BaseModel](basemodel.md) extension to Backbones Model class.

BaseViews can provide a lot of handy functionality, that you - the frontend dev - don't have to implement yourself then.
BaseViewControllers provide means for animations and transitions between screens of full screen applications and many other 
useful links.
